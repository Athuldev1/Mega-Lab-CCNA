# Mega-Lab CCNA 🚀

This repository documents my **incremental Mega-Lab project** built during my CCNA studies using Jeremy's IT Lab and Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The goal is to design and configure a realistic enterprise network step by step, integrating concepts like VLANs, OSPF, NAT, Wireless, and eventually **Automation & Cloud**.

## 📌 Current Scope
- Two-site enterprise: HQ (Bangalore) + Branch (Pune).
- VLANs: Servers, Users, Management, Wireless.
- WAN connectivity between sites.
- Internet access with DMZ.

## 🏗 Project Structure
- `diagrams/` → Network topologies (ASCII + screenshots).
- `configs/` → Router & Switch configs.
- `labs/` → Step-by-step guides for each CCNA topic.
- `automation/` → Python & Ansible automation scripts.

## 🚦 Learning Roadmap
- [ ] VLANs
- [ ] Inter-VLAN Routing
- [ ] STP
- [ ] OSPF
- [ ] NAT & ACLs
- [ ] Wireless
- [ ] IPv6
- [ ] Automation
- [ ] Cloud Integration

Stay tuned: every CCNA concept I learn will become a lab + config here.
